### **2\. Scope of this policy**

This privacy policy describes how data is processed when you use the WeLearn platform.

Use of the platform is open, without the creation of a user account, and without direct identification of users.

No personal data is required to access the platform’s main features.

For purely technical purposes, an anonymous user identifier may be assigned to ensure the proper functioning of the platform and to improve the user experience. This identifier does not allow the identification of a natural person under any circumstances.

This policy covers the following features:

* resource search,  
* chat,  
* generation of educational syllabi from documents provided by the user,  
* feedback form.

---

### **3\. Purposes of processing**

The processing carried out on the WeLearn platform pursues the following purposes:

* providing access to educational resources from open sources,  
* assisting users in understanding content and preparing educational materials,  
* offering features that support research, reasoning, and content structuring through artificial intelligence tools,  
* collecting feedback in order to improve the platform.

---

### **4\. Data from public and open sources**

The WeLearn platform relies on a database built from publicly accessible, open-access scientific publications and reports from open sources.

These contents may contain limited personal data, such as:

* authors’ names,  
* their institutional affiliations,

as they appear in the original documents.

This data is processed exclusively for educational, research, and informational purposes, in particular for:

* content indexing,  
* thematic analysis,  
* citation and contextualization of resources.

Processing is based on the legitimate interest of the Learning Planet Institute in supporting research and education (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR).

No profiling of authors is carried out. The platform does not aim to contact, evaluate, or enrich data relating to researchers, and no additional data is inferred beyond what is present in the original sources.

### **5\. Data processed by feature**

#### **5.1 Resource search**

The search functionality relies on public and open resources.

No personal data is required to obtain a response.

When you perform a search:

* the entered terms are processed temporarily to produce a response,  
* no personal data is collected,  
* queries are neither stored nor retained after the response.

---

#### **5.2 Chat**

The chat feature relies on the use of artificial intelligence tools, including natural language processing models, to generate responses based on user queries.

When you use the chat:

* the entered messages are processed temporarily to generate a response,  
* the content is neither stored nor reused,  
* no artificial intelligence model training is carried out using these exchanges.

The platform does not aim to collect personal data through the chat.

However, you remain free to enter personal information in your messages if you choose to do so.

---

#### **5.3 Generation of educational syllabi from user-provided documents**

This feature is intended to assist users in preparing educational content based on documents they provide.

In this context:

* you may upload documents (PDF, text, etc.),  
* these documents are processed temporarily, including through the use of artificial intelligence tools, in order to produce the requested response,  
* the files are not stored on the platform.

---

#### **5.4 Feedback form**

When you complete the feedback form, the following data is collected:

* last name,  
* first name,  
* email address,  
* profession.

This data is collected only after obtaining your explicit consent, via a checkbox presented before completing the form.

These fields are mandatory in order to:

* ensure that feedback comes from the target audience (higher education),  
* limit irrelevant responses,  
* enable qualitative follow-up of the feedback provided.

Responses are accessible only to authorized members of the internal WeLearn project teams.

---

### **6\. Legal basis and data subjects**

The processing mainly concerns:

* teachers,  
* researchers,  
* instructional designers,  
* more broadly, higher education professionals using the platform.

Processing is based on:

* the legitimate interest of the Learning Planet Institute in offering and improving a non-commercial educational tool,  
* and, for the feedback form, on the consent of the data subjects.

### **9\. Data retention periods**
