### **2\. Scope of this policy**

This privacy policy describes how data is processed when you use the WeLearn platform.
Use of the platform is open, without the creation of a user account, and without direct identification of users.
No personal data is required to access the platform’s main features.

- For purely technical purposes, a pseudonymous (random) user or session identifier may be assigned to ensure the proper functioning of the platform and to improve the user experience. This identifier is designed not to directly identify you, but it may still be considered personal data under the GDPR when it can be linked to a user session or combined with other information.
- Use during one-off events (workshops, learning festivals, online seminars)
- WeLearn may be used during one-off online events. In that context, participants are informed through an event-specific information notice (for example, a notice displayed next to the workshop access link or provided through a form), which provides more detailed information about the processing carried out for that event, including purposes, categories of data, legal basis, retention periods, security measures, and how to exercise rights. During such events, personal data may be collected, including (as applicable): registration details, participation data, and interactions with the platform. Where required, participants’ consent is collected.
- This policy covers the following features:
- resource search,
- chat,
- generation of educational syllabi from documents provided by the user,
- feedback form,
- one-off events (workshops) when applicable.

---

### **3\. Purposes of processing**

The processing carried out on the WeLearn platform pursues the following purposes:

- providing access to educational resources from open sources,
- assisting users in understanding content and preparing educational materials,
- offering features that support research, reasoning, and content structuring through artificial intelligence tools,
- collecting feedback in order to improve the platform,
- ensuring the security, integrity, and proper functioning of the platform (for example, detecting abuse and troubleshooting).

---

### **4\. Data from public and open sources**

The WeLearn platform relies on a database built from publicly accessible, open-access scientific publications and reports from open sources.
These contents may contain limited personal data, such as:

- authors’ names,
- their institutional affiliations,

as they appear in the original documents.
This data is processed exclusively for educational, research, and informational purposes, in particular for:

- content indexing,
- thematic analysis,
- citation and contextualization of resources.

Processing is based on the legitimate interest of the Learning Planet Institute in supporting research and education (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR).
No profiling of authors is carried out. The platform does not aim to contact, evaluate, or enrich data relating to researchers, and no additional data is inferred beyond what is present in the original sources.

---

### **5\. Data processed by feature**

#### 5.1 Resource search

The search functionality relies on public and open resources.
No personal data is required to obtain a response.
When you perform a search:

- the entered terms are processed temporarily to produce a response,
- no personal data is collected,
- queries are neither stored nor retained after the response.

---

#### 5.2 Chat

The chat feature relies on the use of artificial intelligence tools, including natural language processing models, to generate responses based on user queries.

When you use the chat:

- the entered messages are processed temporarily to generate a response,
- the content is neither stored nor reused,
- no artificial intelligence model training is carried out using these exchanges.

The platform does not aim to collect personal data through the chat.

Exception for one-off events (workshops): during certain one-off events, chat messages and related interaction data (such as timestamps and source interaction) may be logged in a pseudonymous form, as described in the event-specific information notice provided to participants.

---

#### 5.3 Generation of educational syllabi from user-provided documents

This feature is intended to assist users in preparing educational content based on documents they provide.

In this context:

- you may upload documents (PDF, text, etc.),
- these documents are processed temporarily, including through the use of artificial intelligence tools, in order to produce the requested response,
- the files are not stored on the platform.

---

#### 5.4 Feedback form

When you complete the feedback form, the following data is collected:

- last name,
- first name,
- email address,
- profession.

This data is collected only after obtaining your explicit consent, via a checkbox presented before completing the form.
These fields are mandatory in order to:

- ensure that feedback comes from the target audience (higher education),
- limit irrelevant responses,
- enable qualitative follow-up of the feedback provided.

Responses are accessible only to authorized members of the internal WeLearn project teams.
Depending on the context (for example, one-off events), a feedback form may also be organised in a way that does not request directly identifying information and instead uses a pseudonymous session/user ID, as described in the relevant event-specific information notice.

---

#### 5.5 One-off events (workshops, learning festivals, online seminars)

When WeLearn is used during a one-off event, we may process pseudonymous participation and interaction data, such as: a random session/user ID, timestamps, user queries/messages, AI responses, and interactions with sources (for example, citation clicks). Depending on the event format, we may also process event administration data such as registration details and/or participation information (for example, via the event registration or videoconference tool used for access).

Participants are informed through an event-specific information notice that provides more detailed and specific information about that event’s processing, including the purposes, legal basis, security measures, retention period, recipients, and how to exercise rights. Where required, the event-specific notice also includes a consent form with checkboxes (“I agree” / “I refuse”) and confirmation that the participant has read the information notice.

---

### **6\. Legal basis and data subjects**

The processing mainly concerns:

- teachers,
- researchers,
- instructional designers,
- more broadly, higher education professionals using the platform.

Processing is based on:

- the legitimate interest of the Learning Planet Institute in offering and improving a non-commercial educational tool,
- for the feedback form, on the consent of the data subjects,
- and, where applicable, on additional legal bases described in event-specific information notices for one-off events (including, where appropriate, consent for optional research use).

---

### **7\. Data recipients**

Personal data is processed **by authorised staff of the data controller** (Learning Planet Institute).

It is not disclosed to any third parties and is not shared for commercial purposes.

---

### **8\. Security and hosting**

Data is accessible only to authorized members of the internal WeLearn project teams.

Appropriate technical and organizational measures are implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of data, and to prevent any unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or disclosure.

The infrastructure used is hosted within the European Union, mainly in France.
For one-off events, additional safeguards may be applied as described in the event-specific information notice (for example, stricter access control and shortened retention).

---

### **9\. Data retention periods**

Data collected through the feedback form is retained for a maximum period of 24 months for the purposes of analysis and platform improvement, after which it is deleted or anonymized.

Data processed temporarily (search, chat, uploaded documents) is not retained.
For one-off events where pseudonymous interaction logs are collected, the applicable retention period is specified in the event-specific information notice. This includes (as applicable) retention rules for registration/participation data and for platform interaction logs collected during the event.

---

### **10\. Your rights**

In accordance with the provisions of the French Data Protection Act No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended (“Loi Informatique et Libertés”), you have the following rights:

- right of access,
- right to rectification,
- right to erasure,
- right to restriction of processing,
- right to object,
- right to data portability where applicable,
- right to lodge a complaint with the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL).

Where processing is based on legitimate interests, you may object on grounds relating to your particular situation. Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time (withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal).

To exercise your rights, you may contact the DPO of the Learning Planet Institute at the following address:

[_lamis.chamas@learningplanetinstitute.org_](mailto:lamis.chamas@learningplanetinstitute.org)

If you participated in a one-off event, you may be asked to provide your random session/user ID (if available) so we can locate your data.

### **11\. Cookie management**

The WeLearn platform uses only cookies that are strictly necessary for its operation (functional cookies).
These cookies are essential for the proper functioning of the site and do not require your consent, in accordance with applicable regulations.
No advertising or tracking cookies for commercial purposes are used.
