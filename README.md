## Introduction

This project is built with Vue.js and serves as SDG Expert to help teachers and students incorporate SDGs into their classes. While it is open-source, please note that **this project is not open to contributions** at the moment.

## Features

- **Chat**: The chat uses GPT-4 Mini with Qdrant for similarity search, enabling teachers to create SDG-focused content. Teachers can filter results by SDG or source to access verified, relevant information for course development.
- **Search**: The search feature uses Qdrant for similarity-based searching, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant, contextually similar content from a database of verified sources.
- **Bookmark**: The bookmark page allows teachers to easily access and organize all documents they've saved from the search or chat features. It provides a centralized location to view and manage bookmarked resources, making it simple to revisit relevant materials for course development.

### API Dependency

This project relies on a REST API that handles all interactions with the database and the large language model (LLM) service. **Certain features of the application will only function correctly if the API is up and running.**

If you're encountering issues with features not working or receiving errors, itâ€™s possible that the API is down or unreachable. You find instructions for setting up the API by visiting the [API repository](https://github.com/CyberCRI/WeLearn-api).

Ensure that you have the API running locally or connected to a live instance for full functionality. The app communicates with the API to fetch data and interact with the LLM service, so both need to be operational for a complete experience.

### Project strucutre

The project follows a standard Vue 3 application structure. Here's an overview of the directory layout:

- **`src/`**: Contains all the source code for the web application, including components, views, and stores. This is where the main development of the app takes place.

  - `src/components/`: Contains reusable Vue components.
  - `src/views/`: Contains the main views or pages of the app.
  - `src/store/`: Contains Pinia store(s) for state management.

- **`tests/`**: Contains all the unit and integration test files for the application. This folder includes the test suite for the core functionality of the app.

- **`e2e/`**: Contains end-to-end tests for the application. These tests are powered by Playwright, ensuring that the entire flow of the web app works as expected in real-world scenarios.
